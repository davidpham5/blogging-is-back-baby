Amazon didn't plan for more office space when workers retun back to the office (RTO) five days of the week. 

> The company had originally planned to bring all employees back to the office [five days a week](https://qz.com/amazon-return-to-work-five-days-a-week-1851649315?_gl=1*y701ym*_ga*MTY1NjQyMDgwNC4xNzIxMDcwOTUy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyOTI1MTEyNC4yODUuMC4xNzI5MjUxMTI2LjU4LjAuMA..) starting Jan. 2, 2025, but certain locations are [not yet prepared](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-delays-full-rto-some-staff-workspace-shortages-2024-12) to accommodate the full workforce, according to Business Insider, which cites internal notifications.

Other workplaces that recently announced RTO have described similar situations: leadership did not think through that they could succeed in making workers come back to the office and what that would mean in terms of limited office space. It's as if they're making it up as they go along.
