Loneliness of men is a very serious thing. Scott Galloway and Sean Illing talked about what's going on with young men. I have a son too, and I can see myself in these men: falling into usual traps, feeling like a loser, and not knowing what to do. What saved me was a single male role model, my history teacher. I wanted to be just as smart, handsome, and ambitious as him. Made two of the three of them. I'll let you decide which ones.
