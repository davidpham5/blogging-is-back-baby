title: 'News companies gave up on distribution and ceded to giant platforms, Google and Facebook'

Nilay Patel interviews with Matt Pearce, formerly of the LA Times, for Decoder. Patel writes:

> Without question, our medium — and our messages — are dominated by big platforms, which distribute the vast majority of information to the public. Over the past decade, publishers of journalism have mostly ceded all of their distribution to Facebook, Google Search, and now, short-form video platforms like TikTok.

Kara Swasher has been known to refer to platforms such as Facebook and Google as "ravenous information thieves". I think thats being too generous to them.
