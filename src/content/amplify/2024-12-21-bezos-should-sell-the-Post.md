**[Kara Swasher is putting together a consortium of wealthy investors](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/20/scoop-kara-swishers-long-shot-kara-swisher-washington-post-ownership-bidpost-bid)** to fund a bid for the Post. It's a long shot, namely because Mr. Bezos has not shown any interest in selling it.

However, there is nobody more attune to the media business nor knows more about technology as an industry than Ms. Swasher. ["Her entire career has been focused on sharp, smart, good journalism,"](https://daringfireball.net/2024/12/journalism_requires_owners_committed_to_the_cause) writes John Gruber of Daring Fireball. The Washington Post has a talented and incredible Engineering and Product department. The newsroom is world class and continuously produces courageous and incredible journalism. All is needed is the right kind of leadership and owner -- a person who's attention and focus would be the business of the Washington Post. And Ms. Swasher is the right leader to own and lead the Washington Post. If there one thing to know about Ms. Swasher, she is committed to journalism through and through.

Bezos should sell the Post to Swasher. He should continue to follow his passion, Blue Origin and Amazon. He cares for the Post, but not nearly enough to be committed to the level that is needed. [Just looking at his recent interview with Andrew Ross Sorkin of DealBook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s71nJQqzYRQ), he clearly is excited about space exploration, and not so much news and media. Shedding the Post would free him up and discharge him of any criticism around conflicts of interest.

[A malicious storm is coming very soon](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/17/trump-legal-threats-media). I know the Post will be ready for it. I don't think Bezos has the stomach for the stormy seas. But Ms. Swasher certainly does.
