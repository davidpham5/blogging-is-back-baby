I live in Montgomery County, Maryland. It makes me incredibly proud that we are a leader in housing, in a blue state nontheless. Abdallah Fayyad of Vox writes: 

> Montgomery County has long prioritized affordable housing...But the county got creative with how it could provide public housing: It set aside a fund to finance and develop housing projects. And while the county partners with private developers, its investment makes it a majority owner of a given project. As [the New York Times put it](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/25/business/affordable-housing-montgomery-county.html), the county, as an owner, becomes “a kind of benevolent investor that trades profits for lower rents

Branding around public housing is riddled with ideas around limited section 8 housing, poverty, underfunded neglected neighborhoods, and vouchers that have a wait time 20+ years.

> leaders have coalesced around calling the mixed-income idea ‘social housing’ produced by ‘public developers,’” [Cohen](https://www.vox.com/policy/2024/2/10/24065342/social-housing-public-housing-affordable-crisis) wrote. But in effect, the model is still publicly owned units being rented to residents at subsidized rates.

We have all the tools to address housing and do it in a smart effective way. What's more, notice this is a local county program -- not federal. Exciting indeed.
