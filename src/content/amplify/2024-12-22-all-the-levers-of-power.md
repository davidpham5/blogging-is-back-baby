ABC news settled out of court a defamation suit. George Stephanopoulo was pissed that ABC decided not to fight and instead folded like a bag of leaves. This bodes poorly for the free press and the Republic. I don't know of many places that are ready for what is to come. Sarah Ellison and Jeremy Barr for the Post:

>“Settlement decisions aren’t made in a vacuum. Each major decision to settle sends a signal about the broader climate for the press. It can spur other public figures to sue over perceived slights and pressure other media outlets to self-censor.”...legal experts say Trump has taken attacks on the press to an entirely new level, softening the ground for an [erosion](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/11/01/trump-fcc-media-crackdown/?itid=lk_inline_manual_48) of robust press freedom.

Obeying in advance like Mr. Bezos is a hop skip away from Fascism.
