What is it that turns seemingly grown men into babies. Does having billions of dollars do something to their brains?

[Chance Miller of 9to5 Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2025/01/10/mark-zuckerberg-joe-rogan-apple-innovation/) listened to Mark Zuckerberg air his grievances to Joe Rogan without acknowledging his only invention (Facebook) was 20 years ago (2005) as well:

> “[Apple has] used the [iPhone] to put in place a lot of rules that I think it feel arbitrary. I feel like they haven’t really invented anything great in a while. It’s like Steve Jobs invented the iPhone and now they’re just kind of sitting on it 20 years later.

Mr. Zuckerberg had one good idea and it ran it's course. Even the Ray-Ban smart glasses are not his invention. It's an extension of the Oculus Rift technology, which he acquired.

He goes on. While Meta doesn't provide third-party access to Instagram, WhatsApp, Threads, or Facebook, Mr. Zuckerberg wants to gesture with his other hand, Apple does not give it's special private protocol (Airpods use to pair with iPhones) to Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses.

> They build stuff like AirPods, which are cool, but they’ve just thoroughly hamstrung the ability for anyone else to build something that can connect to the iPhone in the same way.
> 
> There were a lot of other companies in the world that would be able to build like a very good earbud, but Apple has a specific protocol that they’ve built into the iPhone that allows AirPods to basically connect to it.
> 
> It’s just much more seamless because they’ve enabled that, but they don’t let anyone else use the protocol. If they did, there would probably be much better competitors to AirPods out there.

Mr. Zuckerberg does not tell Mr. Rogan here that Android and Android devices exist. With his billions and billions of dollars, Mr. Zuckerberg could create a special protocol to pair with Ray-Ban smart glasses on Android devices. After all, he did drop out of school as a mildly above average programmer. 

Mr. Zuckerberg's immense wealth is so utterly unbearable, it breaks any comfort of his achievements. Like a fat cat, weak and soft from eating endless catnip, he can't stand his own success. Mr. Zuckerberg built [a chaos machine](https://bookshop.org/a/9695/9780316703321) that he himself no longer can control. But hey, at least he has that [molly dealer from Chechnya](https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/jimmy-kimmel-says-mark-zuckerberg-152408159.html?guccounter=1) look going for him.
