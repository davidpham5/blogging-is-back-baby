Reuters interviewed Mr. Bezos on Sunday evening, January 11th, 2025. Mr. Bezos believes Mr. Musk is not acting out of self-interest but in the the interest of public in respects to SpaceX:

> "Elon has been very clear that he's doing this for the public interest and not for his personal gain. And I take him at face value," said Bezos, founder of Blue Origin which rivals SpaceX in the space industry.
