The Washington Post's Brianna Sacks, Joyce Sohyun Lee, Imogen Piper and Aaron C. Davis dive deep in what could of caused the recent historic fires in LA. The Post built some powerful tools for journalists in recent years, one of which is designed to help sift through mounds of visual data. The work of engineers, data scientist, and of course our reporters really shows in this piece.

One passage stood out to me, I'd like to share: 

> The Post identified the burn scar of the New Yearâ€™s Eve fire using false-color satellite imagery taken before and after the blaze. The technique tracks changes to vegetation in satellite imagery. Healthy plant cover appears red, while the scorched ground appears blue to brown.

The staff at the Post rise to the occasion; always will.
