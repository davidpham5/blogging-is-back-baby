Costco is going to raise pay for most of their hourly workers to more than $30 bucks. Costco and Apple are two major corporations who said no to ending their anti-discrimination policies. Also both share another thing in common: highest dollar per square foot retail.

It ain't no a coincidence they are two of the most beloved brands and companies in the country.
