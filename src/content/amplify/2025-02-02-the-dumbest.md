The editorial board at WSJ thinks President Trump is imposing tariffs for no reason. Here, WSJ and me agree: 

>Tariffs are taxes, and when you tax something you get less of it. Who pays the tariff depends on the elasticity of supply and demand for the specific goods.

We also agree Trump is stupid to pursue these tariffs. We all lose.
