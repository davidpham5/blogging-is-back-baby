Amaya Edwards reports on a net on storm drains helps solves for plastic pollution:

> The nets collect the rubbish that comes out of the drainage pipe, so the water is clean when it goes into the rivers and streams. The nets get changed periodically and the rubbish is taken to the local waste removal area for sorting. Anything that can be recycled gets put in the recycling.
