Mr. Musk is he is just some guy, with no authority to do what is doing. He's hijacked the Federal Government, breached sensitive systems including the Treasury's Direct Payment System. Let me put it this way: a foreigner who's loyalty is not to the Republic, infiltrated and plundered the people's money and laws. It looks to me an inside job as half of Congress are silent to the very thing they swore to protect. And his arrogance, fat and satisfied, is only matched by the depth of his loneliness and hatred. Aren't we tired of his hubris. 

We must hit him where it hurts: telsa, spacex, and twitter. Maybe Diablo/Path of Exile 2, to which is an average player. Governor Newsom should send state inspectors to Telsa. Governor DeSantis of Florida should think about his ambitions to be president requires a republic to exist. Go find waste and fraud at spacex. Senator Cruz, the biggest troll in the Senate, is smarter than Musk. He should put Maximum Effort in securing his 2028 presidential ambitions too. Go fuck in the Senate with investigations on starlinks. Has Musk been working with the Russians? the Chinese? Cruz should make a big fuss about it.
