> That's an old one. Old and true. And sturdy. One of the best navigational tools ever built. Can't be jammed or intercepted. Something breaks, you can fix it yourself. Hard to learn. Yes, but once you've mastered it, you're free. We've grown reliant on Imperial tech, and we've made ourselves vulnerable. There's a growing list of things we've known and forgotten, things they've pushed us to forget. Things like freedom.  
  
They have herded us like cattle on the way to slaughter. To pacify any loud scared ones, they pull something over our eyes, their slot machine. Traced and dazzled, they whispered wonders and lies. While we forget what freedom was like, they plunder our Republic.
