I've been listening to this NPR Tiny Desk over and over again. I really like the Latin jazz they're doing. I can't eying the shirts, especially the exaggerated faces of Ca7riel and Poco Amoroso. 

When I studied aboard in Mexico, I came back to the States with an appreciation for Latin jazz. I had a whole phase of it for a couple years.
