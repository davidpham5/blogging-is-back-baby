Judge Susan Crawford wins Wisconsin Supreme Court seat and solidifying a 4-3 liberal majority. Mr. Musk spent $25 million dollars in attempt to buy the seat. He lost and lost big. Judge Crawford won 55% to Judge Schimel's 45%. In a state that Mr. Trump won narrowly and for a state that goes one way or the other in the tiniest slivers of margins, Judge Crawford's win is a punch right at the nose of the tyrants.
