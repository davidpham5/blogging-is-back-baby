The clarity Te'Nehisi Coates brings to his writing and thinking is why he is so effective in driving uncomfortable truths. I keep revisiting his writing because it so closely resembles James Baldwin. It strikes like a hammer and cuts like knife. His words haunts me like a night of regrets and embarrassments.
