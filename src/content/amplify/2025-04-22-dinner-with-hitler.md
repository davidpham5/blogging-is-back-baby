Larry David for the New York Times Opinion, wrote a piece satirizing [Bill Mahar's dinner with a dictator](https://davidchicopham.com/posts/what-if-charlie-chaplin-had-dinner-with-adolf-hitler-after-watching-the-great-dictator-together/) at the invitation of Kid Rock. 

Larry David on Hitler is so charming: 
> I joked that I was surprised to see him in a tan suit because if he wore that out, it would be perceived as un-Führer-like. That amused him to no end, and I realized I’d never seen him laugh before. Suddenly he seemed so human. Here I was, prepared to meet Hitler, the one I’d seen and heard — the public Hitler. But this private Hitler was a completely different animal. And oddly enough, this one seemed more authentic, like this was the real Hitler. The whole thing had my head spinning.

Subversive and cunning, the whole thing is brilliant. See?! Bill Mahar, this is the difference of being funny versus being played.
