I think writing is suppose to be somewhat uncomfortable, confusing and painful. But I did not considered it might be unnatural thing to do. I suppose it can be argued that written word as a recent invention to our existence means that reading and writing is not a built-in human instinct but rather a deliberately taught thing. [Adam Mastroianni shares 28 slightly rude notes on writing](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/28-slightly-rude-notes-on-writing) Number 10 is one that resonates with me:

>Maybe it’s because writing is inherently lonely, or maybe it’s because the only people who would try to make a living from writing are messed up in the head.

 Personally, I think the reason is far more sinister: making art is painful because it forces the mind to do something it’s not meant to do. If you really want to get that sentence right, if you want that perfect brush stroke or that exquisite shot, then you have to squeeze your neurons until they scream. That level of precision is simply unnatural.
