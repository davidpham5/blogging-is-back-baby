Remember when they were mad about Little Mermaid being black? Well now, they are mad about Superman being nice. Parker Molloy gets right to it. The extreme nature of the right wing media means basic things like kindness is seen as a cultural attack.

> But this isn't really about Superman. It's about how conservative media takes the most innocuous statements and transforms them into culture war ammunition. It's about how the right-wing ecosystem has become so reflexively oppositional that even "basic human kindness" reads as a partisan attack.
> 
> And perhaps most tellingly, it's about what happens when you've built an entire media apparatus that needs a constant supply of things to be mad about â€” even if that means getting upset that Superman, of all characters, stands for truth, justice, and helping people.

If they are mad at Superman for being nice, wait until they learn about Jesus.
