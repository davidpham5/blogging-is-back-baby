I have a lot reasons. Spotify as a public company has to grow and it's main competition is silence. In trying to fill in that silence (because we can't stand to be with our thoughts), It really changed the relationship of music to fans by focusing on playlists and algorithmic discovery. Publications like PitchFork, whose coverage on music and surfacing new artists was largely ended by Spotify's recommendation engine.

spotify has squeezed artists by paying them smaller and smaller royalties for a long time now. Their biggest expense is paying people. And now here comes a new technology: AI in the form of generating music. Background music such chill hip hop is being supplanted by AI Slop. By taking over playlists, Spotify is cultivating AI to replace artists and musicians.
