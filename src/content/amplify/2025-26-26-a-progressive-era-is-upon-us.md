Today I had a thought regarding the Progressive Era of American politics. Wealth inequality hasn't been this significant since the gilded age. It wasn't till Teddy Roosevelt went around, yelling that busting the trust was a very good thing to do. His platform, the Square Deal, centered fairness as it's key message. He essentially ran on anti-corruption anti-monopoly platform. It was hugely popular as well. 

AOC and Bernie seem to be the last politicians with any fight in them. Democrats should really learn from them and get it together. Cruel and horrible things are happening now. Trump fired (illegally) 15 Inspector Generals across many departments and agencies. Unfettered corruption will happen in board daylight. A politician like AOC is the right kind of leader now. At least she got spine of steel:
