The B-69's are a band who sings in the style of the B-52s Love Shack. [1979 Fred's Version](https://theb69s.bandcamp.com/album/1979-freds-version) includes Chop Suey, Bad Idea Right, and All Star. It's really fun mashup that shouldn't work but does. Its on my repeat playlist, and my daughter loves it too.
