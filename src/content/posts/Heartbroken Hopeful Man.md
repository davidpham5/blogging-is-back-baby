Kurt Vonnegut, as described by Jon Stewart, was a [broken hopeful man](https://overcast.fm/+BLShPpD2Lo/1:05:15). A man who witnessed the horror of the bombing of Dresden and World War II. Yet, in his writing, he often thought about what people could be – their capacity to be good and do remarkable things.

My dad and I don't talk about what happened during the Vietnam War, but when I was studying it in college, I got a small understanding of the cruelty of it. I tried to imagine my father as a young boy and then teenager witnessing death, chaos, and violence on a scale that no one person can fully understand. Imagine young girls with skin burned off by napalm. Young men blown to pieces and unrecognizable in their remains. I think it's not too different from a Palestinian in Gaza in 2024. He, luckily, fled to the United States in 1972, escaping that harrowing nightmare.

My dad came to the United States with a sense of optimism. Here, there is no war; there are no spontaneous bombs dropping from clear skies. There were no late-night air sirens, whispering impending doom to sleeping children. No minefields to blow off legs and arms. That violence was far away. With nothing but abundance, cocaine, champagne, and 1970s rock, my dad must have felt real good about the future. Maybe his dreams and ambitions could be founded here. Maybe everything is going to be okay.

My dad's dreams and ambitions did not work out the way he imagined. He's very much the shadow of himself today. Unemployed for years, treated as less than by his White bosses, looked down upon by others in his community, seen as a man past his prime whenever he applied for senior-level jobs. His inability to provide for his family – that does something to a man that is an unrelenting sense of despair. And what that does to young men is radicalization.

Donald Trump won and won decisively. He won big with young men across all races, incomes, and geography. He won young Hispanic men in a significant way. Senator Bernie Sanders offered this statement about the election:

>It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working-class people would find that the working class has abandoned them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well. While the Democratic leadership defends the status quo, the American people are angry and want change. And they're right.

How did Nazi Germany recruit young men to join the Brown Shirts? There's an idea that you won't find happy, joyful men becoming Nazis. Fascism requires certain discontent, loneliness, disaffection, and **humiliation** in young men to radicalize them with propaganda. The country made a choice to elect "America's Hitler"– a statement by Vice President-Elect JD Vance in respect to President-Elect Donald Trump.

I am a heartbroken hopeful man. Yes, indeed, even after the election results made it clear that the country elected a king. The work to serve our democracy starts today. I aim to gather, organize, and lift up other heartbroken hopeful people. We should not cede any uncontested and unchallenged ground. We must reach out to young men and build relationships with them. The cure for loneliness is not power and domination but community and service. There's a faith I have in believing these unremarkable young boys can transform into remarkable men, with character and integrity. We cannot give up on them. We cannot let them be lost by the air sirens of Fascism, whispering their problems can be solved by one man.

You certainly can say that you didn't like the result of the election, but find solace in knowing you're not alone. Don't cooperate and definitely say no. Make it hard for Fascists to make you do what they want you to do. Make it clear that you're not afraid. Their thuggery relies on others being scared and alone. Make them work for their rule. And lastly, don't obey in advance.

I've recently revisited Rick Steves's Story of Fascism to understand its power in capturing the minds of people.  Watching the video, I hope you see that fascism is not some distant memory that happened long ago, but a phenomenon that arises when the conditions are ripe for it. I believe that conditions are ripe for it, now.
