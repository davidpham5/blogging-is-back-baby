What keeping a bullet journal can teach you about using to-do list apps – The Verge

I, at one time, wanted to achieve god-tier bullet journaling. As it turns out I was more interested in buying into the life style around an organized successful person, than being an organized successful person. I still carry my leather-bound 3 stack journal, and once in a while confess some thought, or past memory. I do believe the act of writing sharpens the mind -- the act of physically using a pencil or pen onto paper brings forth the subconscious energy: chaotic and fragmented. Maybe one day I fashion myself a brand new motivation to bullet journal in all it’s aesthetically pleasing allure.
