# "They're so poor, all they have is money" - Kara Swasher

Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, wrote an opinion editorial in his own paper:

> Let me give an analogy. Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must _believe_ they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement. [...]
>
> Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, “I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.” None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer, publisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the same, and he was right. By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.

Mr. Bezos has always been effective writer and this piece demonstrates his command of it. Mr. Bezos has never meddled in the newsroom or editorial decisions during his tenure at the Post. He rarely emails staff and has only appeared in person a handful of times. His been a fantastic owner and steward of the *Post* since his purchase of it in 2015. Until now.

After reading his op-ed a couple of times, I’ll admit—it’s almost convincing. Sure, the media has a trust problem. There’s a perception of liberal bias in the major news outlets. Fox News’s entire business is built on their cynical tagline, "Fair and Balanced.” The saliency of endorsements is also questionable. How many undecided voters read the _Washington Post_'s endorsements in the past and thought to themselves, “Sure, I’ll vote for that guy.”

There’s a discussion to be had about whether a paper like the _Post_ should keep publishing endorsements. But that discussion should’ve happened months ago. A policy change *12 days* before an election—especially _this_ election—isn’t “inadequate planning.” If he’d made this call back at the Republican National Convention, it would’ve been a bad decision. But now? Forget it. This is just a disaster.

In his op-ed, Mr. Bezos argued that presidential endorsements coming from the opinion section—where they publish opinions—is _too much_ opinion, claiming that endorsements “create a perception of bias.”  By blocking the drafted endorsement, Mr. Bezos created a bias for sure: as the owner of the newspaper, only his opinion counts -- steamrolling the independence of editorial section of his newspaper. Instead of the op-ed, he could’ve just tweeted, “It’s my paper, and I’ll do what I want. No endorsements now or ever. If you don’t like it, buy your own newspaper.” At least that would’ve been honest.

In my view, Mr. Bezos intervene in a such a cowardly and obnoxious way, that his letter resulted in compounding a shit-show into a shit-sandwich. Since Friday, October 25, 2024, before his letter, over 200,000 subscribers [cancelled](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/28/nx-s1-5168416/washington-post-bezos-endorsement-president-cancellations-resignations). As of today, after his letter, over [250,000 people canceled their subscription](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5170939/more-than-250-000-subscribers-have-left-washington-post-over-withheld-endorsement). Many comments to Washington Post's CEO and Publisher Will Lewis [original piece on not doing an endorsement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/), suggested the Post betrayed the reader's trust.

 [Oliver Darcy on threads.net](https://www.threads.net/@oliverdarcy/post/DBmEORlvYbh?xmt=AQGzSDA4ApAHGaEAd18jyYGZTBQBEsOR65zHjjtyw_DxXw) makes a good point that the Post's brand is speaking truth to power and gestures a key reason for the enormity of cancellations:

> Readers have been sold on the idea that the paper stands up to the powerful, without fear or favor. If that isn't true anymore, and readers lose confidence that the paper does stand for a noble mission, they will cancel their subscriptions.

Since the beginning of the year, like many media businesses, the _Post_ has made a big push to add more subscribers. That revenue funds reporters, engineers, designers, product, finance, and legal staff. It pays for the kind of investigative journalism that wins Pulitzer Prizes, like the _Post_’s [coverage of the January 6th Insurrection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/09/washington-post-wins-pulitzer-prize-jan-6-coverage/).  Most of the staff at the _Post_ must feel deflated after swimming upstream for so long, only to be blindsided by a reckless, bozo decision that tossed aside their hard work and commitment to the institution. 

Moreover, [Dr. Drang](https://fosstodon.org/@drdrang/113387991801308851) following Mr. Bezos's reasoning by his analogy, it does not occur to Mr. Bezos his intervention is what in politics is called, "bad optics".

> If I’m following Bezos’s logic, he must not just run the Post without letting his other business interests interfere, he must *appear* to run the Post without letting his other business interests interfere. The easy way to do that would be to keep his hands off the editorial board. I wonder why that didn’t occur to him? (No, I don’t really wonder.)

It so happens that on the day Mr. Bezos and Will Lewis blocked the endorsement, [Trump visited the CEO of Blue Origin (Bezos’s space company, which has juicy sweet government contracts to launch satellites)]((https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-this-the-reason-jeff-bezos-owned-washington-post-didnt-endorse-kamala-harris-blue-origin-donald-trump/)). I'm told it's not what it looks like!

Come on. Mr. Bezos's own analogy shows how disastrous a decision to block a drafted endorsement less than two weeks away from the election. Did Mr. Bezos [obey in advance](https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance) like in Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny? It stands to reason that indeed, Mr. Bezos lost his spine somewhere between off the coast of Miami, where his custom yacht is too big to port, and his  [Vogue photoshoot at Yellowstone](https://slate.com/human-interest/2023/11/jeff-bezos-and-lauren-sanchez-vogue-photoshoot.html), where he cosplayed with his girlfriend, um Yellowstone.  What is the point of amassing all the wealth and power if you can't stand up for your own newspaper. 

What does it say when one of the richest and most powerful person on earth, is so scared of a second-term Trump presidency, that he can't count on the rule of law such that his businesses might come under intense scrutiny, even broken up, or taken away? If even Bezos isn’t confident his business would remain secure, what message does that send to the broader business community?

Also, [Jennifer Valentino Devries at NYT](https://www.threads.net/@jenvalentino_nyt/post/DBtsrqLObvS?xmt=AQGzSDA4ApAHGaEAd18jyYGZTBQBEsOR65zHjjtyw_DxXw) puts it in another way what really is the problem:

> This whole Bezos WaPo decision strikes me as emblematic of the way many tech billionaires (or even mere millionaires) seem to think about journalism and, in fact, a plethora of other professions that aren't their own. They think it's easy and that they could do a better job of it than its own practitioners. That it really should be improved by adding technology and a Silicon Valley mindset.
 >
 >His explanation sounds almost absurd, and yet it reminds me of so many other opinions I've heard.

Call it an “education” for Bezos and his billionaire peers, but the ones footing the bill are the staff of the _Post_, _LA Times_, _USA Today_, and other papers across the country. I am very doubtful Mr. Bezos is going to write a check at the end of the year and avoid layoffs. It would suggest that he made a mistake -- something he is not capable in doing. Just how far will the appeasement go in anticipation of a second Trump term, even before the election? I don’t know, but it could cost us more than just a paper’s subscribers.
