# "They're so poor, all they have is money" - Kara Swasher

Jeff Bezos, owner of the Washington Post, wrote an opinion editorial in his own paper:

> Let me give an analogy. Voting machines must meet two requirements. They must count the vote accurately, and people must _believe_ they count the vote accurately. The second requirement is distinct from and just as important as the first. Likewise with newspapers. We must be accurate, and we must be believed to be accurate. It’s a bitter pill to swallow, but we are failing on the second requirement. [...]
>
> Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, “I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.” None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one. Eugene Meyer, publisher of The Washington Post from 1933 to 1946, thought the same, and he was right. By itself, declining to endorse presidential candidates is not enough to move us very far up the trust scale, but it’s a meaningful step in the right direction. I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it. That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.

Mr. Bezos has always been effective writer and this piece demonstrates his command of it. Mr. Bezos has never meddled in the newsroom or editorial decisions during his tenure at the Post. He rarely emails staff and has only appeared in person a handful of times. His been a fantastic owner and steward of the *Post* since his purchase of it in 2015. Until now.

Reading his op-ed a couple of times, I’ll admit—it’s almost convincing. Sure, the media has a trust problem. There is a perception of liberal bias in the major news outlets. The entire business of Fox News is predicated on their cynical tagline, "Fair and Balance". The saliency of endorsements is questionable. How many undecided voters read the Washington Post's endorsement in the past and said to themselves, "Sure, I'll vote for that guy."

There is a discussion to be had regarding whether a newspaper like the Washington Post should continue publishing endorsements. But that discussion should have been months ago. A policy change *12* days before an election, let alone *this* election, is not "inadequate planning".  If he made this call back at the Republican National Convention, it would've been a bad decision. But now? Forget it. This is just a disaster.

Mr. Bezos argued presidential endorsements coming from the opinion section of the paper, where you know, they publish opinions, is *too much* opinion, such that, "endorsements ~~actually do is~~ create a perception of bias."  Mr. Bezos by virtue of blocking the unpublished endorsement, created a big bias for sure: as the owner of the newspaper, only his opinion matters. Instead of doing a fancy op-ed, he should have tweeted, "It's my paper, and I can do what I want. No endorsements now and forever. If you don't like it, buy your own newspaper." At least that would have been honest.

In my view, Mr. Bezos intervene in a such a cowardly and obnoxious way, that his letter resulted in compounding a catastrophe. As of today, over [250,000 people canceled their subscription](https://www.npr.org/2024/10/29/nx-s1-5170939/more-than-250-000-subscribers-have-left-washington-post-over-withheld-endorsement) since Friday, October 25, 2024. Many comments to Washington Post's CEO and Publisher Will Lewis [original piece on not doing an endorsement](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/10/25/washington-post-endorsement/), suggested the Post betrayed the reader's trust.

> Readers have been sold on the idea that the paper stands up to the powerful, without fear or favor. If that isn't true anymore, and readers lose confidence that the paper does stand for a noble mission, they will cancel their subscriptions. - [Oliver Darcey on threads.net](https://www.threads.net/@oliverdarcy/post/DBmEORlvYbh?xmt=AQGzSDA4ApAHGaEAd18jyYGZTBQBEsOR65zHjjtyw_DxXw)

Since of the beginning of the year, like many media businesses, the Post made great effort to adding more subscribers. That revenue pays for reporters, engineers, designers, product, finance, legal staff salaries. It pays for investigative journalism that wins Pulitzer Prizes, like [Washington Post's coverage of January 6th Insurrection](https://www.washingtonpost.com/media/2022/05/09/washington-post-wins-pulitzer-prize-jan-6-coverage/) It so happens, the other person running is a fascist and the person responsible for January 6th. Trump no doubt juiced many publications' traffic and subscriptions. But I am not confident a free press can survive a fascist take over of the Republic. 

Moreover, [Dr. Drang](https://fosstodon.org/@drdrang/113387991801308851) sums up a Mr. Bezos many businesses' interests running into each other like this [funny coincidence Trump visiting Blue Origin CEO](https://www.thedailybeast.com/is-this-the-reason-jeff-bezos-owned-washington-post-didnt-endorse-kamala-harris-blue-origin-donald-trump/) (Mr. Bezos's space company who have sweet, sweet government contracts to launch satellites) and Mr. Bezos's endorsement block:

> If I’m following Bezos’s logic, he must not just run the Post without letting his other business interests interfere, he must *appear* to run the Post without letting his other business interests interfere. The easy way to do that would be to keep his hands off the editorial board. I wonder why that didn’t occur to him? (No, I don’t really wonder.)

I mean come on. Mr. Bezos's own analogy shows how disastrous a decision to block a drafted endorsement less than two weeks away from the election. Did Mr. Bezos [obey in advance](https://snyder.substack.com/p/obeying-in-advance) like in Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny? In my view, yes. It explains Mr. Bezos cowardice and rash decision.

Also, [Jennifer Valentino Devries at NYT](https://www.threads.net/@jenvalentino_nyt/post/DBtsrqLObvS?xmt=AQGzSDA4ApAHGaEAd18jyYGZTBQBEsOR65zHjjtyw_DxXw) put it in another way what the real problem is:

> This whole Bezos WaPo decision strikes me as emblematic of the way many tech billionaires (or even mere millionaires) seem to think about journalism and, in fact, a plethora of other professions that aren't their own. They think it's easy and that they could do a better job of it than its own practitioners. That it really should be improved by adding technology and a Silicon Valley mindset.
 >
 >His explanation sounds almost absurd, and yet it reminds me of so many other opinions I've heard.

Name it as education of Mr. Bezos and other billionaires, but the staff of the Post, LA Times, and USA Today, it's on their dollar. What is the extent of appeasing to a second Trump presidency before even the election? I don't know, but it may cost us more than just a paper's subscribers.
