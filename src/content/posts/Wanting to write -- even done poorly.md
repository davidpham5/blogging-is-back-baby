Anne Lamott in *Bird by Bird* has a passage in the introduction that resonates with me:
> My students at writing workshops have a gift of loving to read, and some of them read
> really fast, are good with words, and some aren't so fast, don't write all that well.
> But they still love good writing, and they want to write. And I say, "Hey! Come on down!"

I am a slow reader and slow writer. My writing process is strange in that I re-read a sentence that I just wrote. I take a beat and re-read it again. I read it a few times more, and then write a few words. Returning to the first sentence, I do this torturous exercise over and over again. It's the only way I can write.

I love good writing though. I have a dull itch to write, even if it's poorly and for my own self-indulgence. I've noticed that it improves my thinking, and at work, I converse slightly more lucidly.

I am going to write more often and get those rounds in.
