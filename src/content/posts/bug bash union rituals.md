During a bug bash this week, a colleague played music over Zoom. One song really stood out. I reached out today for the playlist they played. The song is "Ritual Union" by Little Dragon.

BBC has a live version of Never Let You Go by Georgia. She's does a one woman show for the song and it's amazing:

Also, as a bonus, this song, "Drip Sweat," really thumps the trunk:

I bought an iPod 5.5 gen white on eBay. The screen is a bit pixel-fucked, and the battery is probably worn out too. However, I have a spare. I've ordered a new LCD screen and a black wheel/button to match the white front plate.

I then bought an iPod shuffle on Craigslist for $20!!! It is in pristine condition, but I'll just need to learn how to de-solder and solder a new wire to the logic board.

A colleague bought an iPod from me, and then his music teacher noticed his beautiful iPod 4th gen monochrome and decided he wanted one too.

It would bring me some pain to part with my thick iPod 4th gen monochrome with a 64GB thick battery. It was, after all, my first college iPod. I do have a thin 4th gen one, which is equally lovely.
