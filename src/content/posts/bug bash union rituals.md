During a bug bash this week, a colleague played music over the Zoom. A song was pretty hot on it. I reached out today for the playlist they played. The song is Ritual Unions by Little Dragon.

Also as a bonus, this song, Drip Sweat, thumps the trunk:

I bought a iPod 5.5gen white on ebay. The screen is a little fucked, the battery is probably cooked too. I have a spare though. I've ordered a new LCD screen, and black wheel/button to match against the white front plate.

I then bought a iPod shuffle on Craigslist for $20!!!. It is in pristine condition and I'll just need to learn how to de-solder and solder a new batter to the logic board.

A colleague bought an iPod from me and then his music teacher noticed his beautiful iPod 4th gen monochrome and said to himself he wanted one too.

I would bring me some pain to depart my thick iPod 4th gen monochrome 64gb thick battery. It was after, my first college iPod. I do have a think 4th gen one, which is equally as lovely.
