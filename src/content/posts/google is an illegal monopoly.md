## Google is an Illegal Monopoly

Ever since reading [The Chaos Machine](https://bookshop.org/a/9695/9780316703321) by Max Fisher, I've been convinced Google is, to borrow Kara Swisher's own description, a "ravenous information thief." The Department of Justice won its antitrust case against Google. The verdict says Google is an illegal monopoly. The case started under Trump's DOJ and, as of August 15, 2024, the case is pending prescription of remedies.

Aram Zucker-Scharff wrote a [great piece](https://www.schizochronotopia.com/p/a-brief-list-of-business-units-google) on what breaking up Google could look like. He writes, "YouTube is obviously dangerously overpowered. It needs to be separated from search and ads, but that doesn’t solve some of its core problems." Spun off, YouTube itself would be one of the largest companies in the world, with a market cap in the billions and a platform where its creators (a small minority) can get rich. As an independent company, it will face real competition from other video platforms, which may spur innovation and better arrangements with its creators.

## Eric Schmidt Says the Quiet Part Out Loud

Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google, in a [recent talk](https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220658/google-eric-schmidt-stanford-talk-ai-startups-openai) at Stanford, said the likes of companies such as OpenAI are kicking Google's ass because "working from home was more important than winning." Seemingly, Schmidt is suggesting to these young students -- future titans of the industry -- that smash and grab is a fine way to do business; just have lawyers clean up:
> So, in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor — and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody’s music — what you would do if you’re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you’d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn’t matter that you stole all the content.

> And do not quote me.

This fucking guy. A version of the innovator's dilemma, monopolies, especially the illegal kinds, are lazy and undisciplined in responding to their users' experience. With no real competition, Google got real unfocused. Until OpenAI showed up, it went into panic mode and piled on some AI dust on top of their shitty search. They blame "working from home" for their stagnation.

[The US is considering breaking up the whole company](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/13/technology/google-monopoly-antitrust-justice-department.html). Maybe at least we can get a better search out of it.
