What if I were to tell you that the plot to the Lego Movie shares an uncanny resemblance with Destiny 2: Final Shape? President Business, voiced by Will Ferrel, seeks to harness the power of Krackle (super glue) to freeze the Lego universe in place.

In a striking parallel, the Witness in Destiny 2: Final Shape taunts Zavala, Ikora, Cayde-6, and Crow, as well as the Guardian, about freezing everything into place to end all chaos, change, and suffering. While it may seem far-fetched to connect these two, a movie about legos and videogame about shooting aliens and space magic, I am just trying pursue the Truth here.
