## Grief
I went to a friend's mom funeral the day before. Grief is such a heavy feeling to hold back on. I was thinking during my dear friend speaking, how many men can't cry -- not the fact they don't, but they cannot cry. To see my friend speak with some much love for his mom, and to see him cry, was a special moment. I cried too. Seeing my friend's pain, I felt his weight, his grief in that moment. I told him I loved him.

I once told my mother-in-law how I think everyone in the nation is grieving on some level. This was during the pandemic, and lots of people were dying. And lots of people were going nuts too. I think for many men, the grief of losing something or someone is still there. Buried deep inside, no tears to shed. I think it's a gift to cry, to mourn, and to grieve for a past that never will be.

My dear friend had this eloquent part of his speech where he said in effect, the vacations that were planned, the trips to far away places, the fancy foods will never be. Instead, it was  was visits to the doctor. It was plans for assistant care living.

After I said I love you to him, I didn't try to say anything else. I just hugged him. The best thing to say in these moments is nothing more. The whole point is not try to fix his pain.

## Sacrifice
On July 22, 2024, President Biden stepped aside and ended his presidential campaign. He put aside his personal ambition, a man who wanted nothing more than to achieve Office of the Presidency, a second term. With that, Donald Trump's political luck came to a sudden halt. Trump is now the oldest candidate, with questions around his mental acuity, and a felon record at that.

Vice President Harris, as the presumptive nominee, has set up the campaign's early narrative as the prosecute versus the felon. She's using "Freedom" by Beyonce as her campaign song. She has re-energized the campaign, with 100,000 new volunteers and over $82 million dollars raised in 24 hours. Early polling shows Trump's lead is gone. It feels the sacrifice that President Biden made was right.

## Mourning
I imagine President Biden is mourning his chance to be a second term president. Single term presidents have a mark in history as being so disastrous during their term that the voters reject them. These presidents are remembered as really bad presidents. So being a single term president, Biden might feel he failed the nation, his party, and family.

I think he gave us a real shot in winning the election.
