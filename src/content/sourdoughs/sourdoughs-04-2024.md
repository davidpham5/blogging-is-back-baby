title: Convicted in 34 felonies, Sourdough is in deep trouble
date: 2022-10-19
description: Two country sourdough loaves, baked from the just four ingredients flour, water, yeast, and salt, emerged from a 500F oven. With their golden crusts crackling and their interiors tender and airy, these loaves are a testament to a craft that demands a network of gluten and heat.

Trump is [convicted in 34 felonies](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/30/trump-guilty-verdict-hush-money-trial/). In a first for American history a former president, Donald Trump is convicted for paying hush money. I love that in a court room, evidential scrutiny renders the frequently wrong and always confident into weak and small puddles of snowflake tears.
