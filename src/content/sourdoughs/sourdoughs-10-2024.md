title: The Enemy from Within Sourdoughs
date: 2024-10-19
description: Two country sourdough loaves, baked from the just four ingredients flour, water, yeast, and salt, emerged from a 500F oven. With their golden crusts crackling and their interiors tender and airy, these loaves are a testament to a craft that demands a network of gluten and heat.

With just weeks before the election, Donald Trump has gone full fascist. He's referred to anybody who does not support him as the ["enemy from within"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DauQjmpqZM). Why is this an example of fascism? Because it's a rhetorical tactic used by tyrants to divide people in such a manner as to solicit tribal retribution. In other words, us versus them. And usually, political violence becomes part of their play book.

And yet the race is still a toss up.
