		Oh hey, I'm a Senior Data Privacy Engineer at The Washington Post. I am entirely self-taught software engineer. I studied history and sociology in college. I'm a first-generation American. I believe that my success is not my fault but my hard work is my doing. I find joy and wonder in people's ingenuity and creativity.

    <p>In my spare time I work on <a href="/projects/">making sour doughs for my family to eat</a> and <a href="/sites/">websites</a>. You can find me on <a href="/elsewhere/">various online platforms &amp; communities</a>.</p>
