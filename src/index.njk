		    I am a Senior Privacy Engineer at The Washington Post. My path into web development is somewhat unusual -- I'm a self-taught web dev with an a background in history and sociology. I didn't realize it back then, but my studies actually gave me all the right tools I needed for writing and storytelling. As an engineer, I've been fortunate to work with some of the most talented and creative folks in media and technology.

        Coming from a rare background as a first-generation Mexican-Vietnamese American, Buddhist from the Midwest, and growing up in a working-class family, I often felt like an outsider. The concept of "community" seemed abstract and elusive to me. It was something I didn't quite get. I had a hard time grasping its true meaning. However, over time, I've come to understand that "community" is fundamentally about our relationships with one another. This personal site is an entry to the community of indie web creators and thinkers.
