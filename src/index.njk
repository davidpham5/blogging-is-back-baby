    <p>
		    I am a Senior Privacy Engineer at The Washington Post. I'm a self-taught web dev with an a background in history and sociology. While I didn't know it at the time, my studies gave a gift in storytelling. I've tended to gravitated towards individuals who are a bit contrarian, who are a little rebellious, and who are a little of an outsider. I usually admire their ability to think differently and innovate in ways that are not so obivious. I've been fortunate to work with some of the most talented and creative folks in media and technology.

        As a first-generation American, a midwestern, working class, mixed race Buddhist, I did not fit in growing up. Community, to me was a strange abstract that I didn't quite get. Maybe it was because I was such an outsider that I didn't understand what it meant. I've discovered that commnunity is really how we relate to one another.
