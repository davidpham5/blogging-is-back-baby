  <h1><span class="selected">Oh hey</span>, I'm David Chico Pham.</h1>

  <section class="paragraph">
    <p>
		    I am a Senior Data Privacy Engineer at The Washington Post. I'm a self-taught software engineer with an unconventional perspective -- my background is in history and sociology. The blend of humanities and technology gives me a distinctive viewpoint in my field and craft.

    <p>
        As a first-generation American, a Mid-Western, working class, mixed race Buddhist, I didn't fit in growing up. Community, to me was a strange abstract that I didn't get. As it turns out, there is not such thing as Communityâ„¢. Rather, it's how we related to one another and how we treat each other that makes community meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>In my spare time I work on <a href="/sourdoughts/">making sourdoughs bread</a>, I <a href="/tinker/">tinker</a> with old ipods, and I play a lot <a href='https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116240122/'>Destiny 2</a> -- Warlock main. You can find me on <a href="/elsewhere/">various online platforms &amp; communities</a>.</p>
    <p>You can find out more <a href="/about/">about me</a>, what I <a href="/uses/">use</a>, the books that I <a href="/books/">have been reading</a> and what I am up to <a href="/now/">now</a>.</p>
