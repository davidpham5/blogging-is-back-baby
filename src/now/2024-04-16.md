## What am I currently focused on?

- Building an AI survey analyzer for work.
  - I strongly believe the future of knowledge work is in AI. I do not want to be caught flat footed. To that end, I'm learning more about AI and how to build generative AI co-pilots.

- Write more blog posts on things that I read and have some takes on.
